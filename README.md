# Virtual Cinema Platform

## Overview

This project aims to design and develop a virtual cinema platform that provides users with an immersive movie-watching experience. The platform will include features such as user registration, video upload, on-demand streaming, and integration with IBM Cloud Video Streaming services.

## Design Thinking Approach

We are following a Design Thinking approach to ensure that the platform meets user needs and expectations effectively. Here are the key stages of our approach:

1. **Empathize**:
   - Conducted user interviews and market research to understand user needs and pain points.

2. **Define**:
   - Clearly defined the problem and created user personas to represent our target audience.

3. **Ideate**:
   - Brainstormed ideas for features and functionalities, focusing on user-centered solutions.

4. **Prototype**:
   - Created low-fidelity wireframes and a clickable prototype of the user interface for feedback.

5. **Test**:
   - Conducted usability testing to gather user feedback and iterated on the design.

6. **Develop**:
   - Implemented the platform, including user registration, video upload, and streaming integration.

7. **Test Again**:
   - Conducted thorough testing to ensure platform functionality and performance.

8. **Launch**:
   - Rolled out the platform with a soft launch and planned a marketing strategy for the official launch.

9. **Iterate and Improve**:
   - Continuously gather user feedback and make data-driven improvements to enhance the user experience.
